The paper will refer to a simple library system as a running example to illustrate the framework and relevant models. 
In this simple library system, each book has a unique name and there is only one copy of each book. Each member can borrow at most two books at the same time. The use cases for the system follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add Book 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Input: book name
		\item Pre-condition(s): the name is not empty and the system does not have a book with the specified name.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Add Member
	
	\item Borrow Book
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-condition(s): the book is not already borrowed and the member has borrowed at most one book.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Return Book
	
	\item Delete Book
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-condition(s): the book is not already borrowed.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Delete Member
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pre-condition(s): the member has no borrowed books.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
